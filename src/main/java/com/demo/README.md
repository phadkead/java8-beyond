### Exploring new features from Java 9,10,11,12

In this package we are exploring features such as:
- Static collection methods that look quite concise
- `var` in java and some gotchas. Java is little bit non-verbose. yay!
- unmodifiable list in Java
- httpclient
- Pattern matching (but far from what's there in Scala)
